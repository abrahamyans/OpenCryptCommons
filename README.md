# OpenCryptCommons

**Post-Quantum Selective Disclosure and Threshold Trust Toolkit for Internet Services**

> Project status: pre-award placeholder repository for a planned open-source cryptography project.

OpenCryptCommons is a planned open-source project focused on practical cryptographic building blocks for the open internet.

The project is being prepared as a compact, reusable toolkit for:

* **post-quantum-ready trust migration**
* **selective-disclosure credentials**
* **threshold-based trust and shared key control**
* **developer-friendly integration into internet services**

## Status

This repository is currently a public placeholder for the project scope, technical roadmap, and future implementation work.

The initial development phase is expected to focus on a small, standards-aware, open-source trust layer rather than a monolithic platform.

## Planned first-phase goals

### 1\. Core trust toolkit

A memory-safe core library exposing a compact API for privacy-preserving credential handling and threshold authorization flows.

### 2\. CLI and reference flow

Command-line tooling and a minimal reference implementation to help developers test and evaluate the toolkit.

### 3\. Post-quantum-ready abstractions

A practical integration layer for crypto-agile migration toward post-quantum-capable trust components.

### 4\. One real integration example

A demonstrator showing how the toolkit can be used in a real internet-facing service or protocol.

## Why this project

Internet services increasingly need stronger trust infrastructure than passwords, single-admin keys, or opaque centralized identity systems.

OpenCryptCommons is intended to help bridge the gap between:

* low-level cryptographic standards and libraries
* real-world internet services
* privacy-preserving and commons-oriented infrastructure

The goal is to create a small, reusable building block for digital commons, self-hosted systems, federated services, and public-interest internet software.

## Design principles

* **open source first**
* **standards-aware**
* **memory-safe implementation choices**
* **developer usability**
* **modular architecture**
* **privacy and trust by design**

## Expected technology direction

The implementation direction currently under exploration includes:

* Rust core library
* CLI tooling
* interoperable data formats
* selective-disclosure flows
* threshold trust patterns
* post-quantum-ready migration support

Final technical decisions will be documented publicly as the roadmap is refined.
